**Electronic Signature FEATURES**

1. Legally binding electronic signature, timedate stamped with audit trail for court enforcement. Paid accounts have additional features for court deposition or appearance.
2. Single-page mode: Input form + electronic signature(s) on the same page (most common and simple)
3. Multi-page mode: Multi-step / Multi-Page Forms or where the signor info (i.e. name, price, etc.) is pre-filled (from CRM or another webform, even Excel spreadsheet, etc.) i.e. capture your users one form 1, then fill that into an electronic signature contract on step 2.
4. Can be included in a multi-step flow such as input form, then payment, then signature, or signature then payment, etc.
5. Signed documents are archived and held in trust by Swift Signature should court enforcement be needed (paid accounts required for court enforcement, though both free and paid accounts are legally binding in most countries including the U.S. and E.U.)
6. Multi-Party Consecutive or Concurrent (all-or-none, or partial allowed) signatures (Premium account required)
7. Notification and Automation options - add autoresponders, payment flows, and more
8. Sales flow sessions options available (i.e. real-time phone handoff to a client)
9. Conditional Logic: Show/Hide sections based on a checkbox, radio button option, circle-word (a type of radio button, technically, similar to circling answers on paper forms)
10. Editable / NonEditable fields for use with CRMs and other forms - pre-fill fields like name, email and allow the user to edit, and optionally pre-fill other fields but lock them as non-editable (i.e. purchase price, loan terms, etc.). TIP: Use these to pre-fill a price or terms into a sales contract, and it will look like regular text (not an input.. unless you want it to).

**SALES USE**

Note Swift Signature can be used for anything, but currently most of our clientele are using it for sales.

The system is designed to allow pre-filling via <a href="https://SwiftCloud.AI/support/checkout/product/101#s?site_url=http://swiftCRM.com&utm_source=Wordpress.org&utm_medium=WPplugin&utm_campaign=WPplugin&pr=101&button=CCTAO
" target="_new">Swift CRM</a>, from which you can generate and send the client a session-URL which pre-fills whatever the sales rep knows.

Certain fields can be read-write (i.e. their name, in case the sales rep spells it wrong), others can be read-only (deal terms), then signed online. If needed, the sales rep could then further modify the data in SwiftCRM, and generate a final signable agreement.
