Local Business SEO plugin optimizes your website with microdata for Google, Bing and Yahoo.


== Description ==

An easy and efficient way to **boost your seo ranking**. The Local Business Seo plugin informs all search engines that your website is specifically a type of business located in the city you are in. This will enable local keyword searches like:
* Restaurant
* Painter
* Plumber
* Car dealer
and show your website in their location.

**New: Seo Reviews** on every page automatically created with star rating in google search as seen in screenshot-10.

This small simple plugin will immediately **boost your seo ranking**.

The plugin makes it simple to add important microdata information about your site for SEO purposes.

Employees and Founders can now be added to the microdata by group. Users name, profile url, email, and description are used. This will help with simple searches like "Bakery Chicago Mike", where the person might remember the employee but not where they bought the item.

The plugin uses the http://schema.org/LocalBusiness information schema and incorporates the meta data into your websites footer using the wp_footer() hook form WordPress. The information is packed into the html code of the site and invisible to any visitor.

In the screenshot area you can see what the plugin tells Google about your business website such as

    	Business Name
    	Physical Address
    	Hours of you are open
    	Business contact information
