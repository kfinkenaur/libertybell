That’s why we enhance usability of our Instagram feed by expanding source opportunities. Choose any desired source to fill your Instagram gallery with amazing photos.

Our team wants to be on one more step closer to our customers that’s why Online Code Generator (or simply Demo as we call it) is ready to show the full power and all potential of the Instagram feed right in your browser!

= Instagram API Changes =
Not so long ago Instagram announced changes of its API. In fact, these changes refer to registration of new Instagram plugins. You can learn more about changes in Instagram policy using the following link: [https://www.instagram.com/developer/](https://www.instagram.com/developer/).

Let’s make clear how such changes can affect functioning of our Instagram plugin. Previously any user was able to authorize our Instagram application in 2 different ways:

* Instagram Access Token
* Instagram Client ID

For now, due to the update in Instagram your Client ID registered after November 17 wouldn’t work (or wouldn’t suit your Instagram plugin). It means that there is only one variant left for authorization – using Instagram Access Token. This approach is a lot more comfortable and faster than getting a personal Instagram Client ID. Thereby, mentioned changes do well to the user’s experience.

For Authorization log in your Instagram account in the WordPress admin panel. After that, our Instagram plugin will automatically receive and apply Instagram Access Token. Now you can start using the new Instagram plugin.

= Non-Square Photos in Instagram Feed =
Several months ago Instagram published a new update, which allows uploading photos with any dimensions to your Instagram profile. A lot of Instagram users were waiting for this option for a very long time. No matter what is the primary size of your Instagram photo, now you can publish non-square images. This feature opens up new opportunities for bloggers, photographers and many others who keep Instagram accounts. On the other hand, web audience will see chaos in any Instagram grid where images with different size proportions are displayed.

Owing to non-square Instagram images, the new issue appeared. More freedom for posting means more chaos in your Instagram feed. The issue refers to the outlay of Instagram photos in a grid presented in Instagram plugin InstaShow. For now Instagram photos have different dimensions and they are displayed in different proportions that's why the Instagram feed can look terrible on a website.

We’ve noticed that a lot of users of Instagram plugins faced this issue on their websites. A pleasant look has a great importance for any product. Understanding it, we’ve included non-square Instagram photos support to our Instagram plugin. The new feature will automatically adjust any Instagram images to the square layout. That’s why all photos will be shown in the form of a beautiful Instagram grid. Thereby, we’ve returned an old tradition of standard Instagram shape.

= Showcase =
InstaShow has a great number of customizable features. That’s why, there are lots of possibilities of how your Instagram feed can be displayed on a website. We’ve prepared some good ideas which will help you to get the biggest benefit of using our Instagram plugin. However, remember that you can create anything using your imagination.

* Default settings (2 rows and 3 grids) – here is the composition which we use in our [Online Demo](http://elfsight.com/instagram-feed-instashow/wordpress/?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=wordpressorg&utm_content=description&utm_campaign=instashowlite). In case of using our Instagram feed InstaShow as one of major elements on a web page this settings will be a perfect decoration.
* One-row photo gallery – perfect for driving attraction to the Instagram feed by setting this grid in the center of your content. Use several columns in order to adjust its size to your website’s requirements. You can also implement autorotation mode for more entertaining effect.
* One-column photo gallery – good case if you want to display your Instagram photos from one side of your web content. Instagram plugin will be a good addition for any of your thoughts. For this case, we recommend to use vertical Instagram photo scrolling.
* Large grid with smaller Instagram photos – show more of your Instagram feed at once. Create a big grid, make it responsive and be sure that you have enough Instagram photos in your profile.
* Single Instagram photo grid – don’t want to spend a lot of your website’s space on Instagram? Here is the solution. Show one photo per page in the grid so that your web audience will be able to enjoy your amazing Instagram images.
* Custom source with “only” filter – let’s assume that you want to display some Instagram account (for example, national geographic profile) but show only specific images (for example, Instagram images marked with “nature” hashtag). You can create your custom Instagram grid with such parameters. Just define your main Instagram username in the source field and enter the desired hashtag or multiple hashtags in the “only” filter.
* Custom source with “except” filter – what if you want to exclude some Instagram photos from your feed? You can do this using “except” filter. Firstly, choose all needed sources and then set any Instagram username, hashtag or photo URL in the filter’s field. As a result, your Instagram feed will be free of undesired content.
