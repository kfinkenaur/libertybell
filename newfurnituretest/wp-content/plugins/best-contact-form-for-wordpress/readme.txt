== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Common Questions =

Q: Do your contact forms work on all types of websites?<br />
A: Absolutely! Thousands of users worldwide enjoy the ease of set up and tracking Best Contact Form provides.<br />

Q: Does it work with WordPress?<br />
A: Yes, our plugin makes setting up contact forms on your wordpress blog/site a snap!<br />

Q: Can I use my contact forms to submit credit card information?<br />
A: Not at this time. We may have plans to integrate the required encryption for storing credit card data in the future.<br />

Q: Can I change the design of my contact form (Colors, wording, etc.)<br />
A: Yes. You are free to edit the design of your code, but you must leave the names, hidden fields, and captcha code in tact in order for your form to work properly.<br />

Q: Can I use this with my existing sign up forms? Or with other custom contact forms?<br />
A: Yes! Through our advanced integration system you can use a Best Contact Form to integrate with one of your existing forms. (see video section of our site)<br />

Q: Why should I use your contact form system? I already have a contact form.<br />
A: Most contact form systems that website owners already have simply send an email of the filled out form. Ours does that, while giving you the added ability to:

* Archive every contact form submission
* See which keywords the visitor used to arrive at your site
* See which search engine they used
* See Where the visitor is located
* Learn which keywords are actually converting to sales
* Search contact form submissions
* Export contact form and tracking data to CSV
* SPAM protection

We feel that these features set us apart from a standard contact form.

Q: Can I integrate with my contact forms WITHOUT modifying any of my form code?<br />
A: YES! We have created a new way to integrate your existing forms with our system. If you have a form on your website that works just fine, be it a contact form or a shopping cart registration form, and you would love to know what keywords, search engines, & geographical data the user used when filling out the form, then this is for you!<br />

The new method of integration works as follows:

1. You place a small bit of javascript code ANYWHERE on the page that your form resides on.
2. There is no need to modify your form’s code at all.
3. When a user fills out your form, everything functions as usual, except behind the scenes a COPY of all the data is sent to our servers where we archive it in your account, email you the results, and attach the TRACKING INFORMATION.
4. The regular form is submitted just as before with no interference on our end.

There is no need to BUILD the contact form in our system, or alter anything. This is for people who want to keep their forms working as usual but wish to ENHANCE the data with tracking information. This is a perfect example for people who use shopping cart systems that don’t allow modification of the form code, or don’t want to risk modifying their forms.

Q: Do I need to have PHP, mySQL, ASP to use one of your forms?<br />
A: Nope. All the form processing is handled by OUR servers. So there is no complicated code to configure, and no database software requirements.<br />

Q: What is a CAPTCHA?<br />
A: A CAPTCHA stands for (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. In our implementation, we show your website visitors a graphic that has some text in it ("home","good","food", etc.). A human can easily read this text and enter the letters, thus verifying they are a person.<br />

However, computers have a very difficult time reading text in a graphic. Most SPAM on the Internet results from a computer program someone wrote to deliver large quantities of SPAM as fast as possible. These programs will have a hard time figuring out what CAPTCHA we showed them and will therefore not be validated. 

Q: Can I change the color of the Spam Protection (CAPTCHA)?<br />
A: Yes! If the default text color for the SPAM protection does not fit with the theme of your website, you can change the color by looking at your form code and finding the line that reads: <img src="//www.bestcontactform.com/captcha.php?color=blue" alt="" align="absmiddle" ><br />

1.  Notice the part that says ?color=blue
2.  Change the color after the = to the color of your choice. So, if you would like to change the text to white make it say ?color=white

You can choose from these colors:

*color=white<br />
*color=black<br />
*color=red<br />
*color=green<br />
*color=blue<br />
*color=maroon<br />
*color=teal<br />

Q: I need a more difficult CAPTCHA (Spam Protection). Is this possible?<br />
A: Yes. Our default CAPTCHA just shows familar words, which is suitable for most small to medium sized websites. However, for very large websites where SPAM is a major issue, you can use our complex CAPTCHA by doing the following:

1.  Click the Advanced Tab for your contact form.
2.  Change the Captcha Type to the style you would like.
3.  Click Save
