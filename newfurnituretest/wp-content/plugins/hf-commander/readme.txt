Inserts text above header and/or below footer of any WordPress Site.


== Description ==

Quick and easy way to insert your advertisement text, pictures, hyperlinks in the Header and Footer or even Header or Footer. This pluging hooks your html, text or pictures above the header, which is above your logo and everything at the top or hooks your html, text or pictures below the footer which is below the copyright statement and everything in the footer! AND MUCH MUCH MORE! Use your imagination!

= Notes* =
 
 1. Unchecking the "Check to Enable Both Options" Checkbox causes the both the footer and header not to be enabled but keeps your data you entered stored in the text area. Which is very handy for future references.

Or 

<pre><code><a href=http://www.yourdomainsite.com/>Contact</a></code></pre>


= Features =

No longer would you have to scratch your brain to find out what is CSS and where to put it. 
Now includes just four powerfully needed sections,

1. You can change the text color and background color with just two clicks.

2. In the option panel, First click for inserting a color expands a glorious color picker utility – no need for knowledge of html hex colour codes

3. Uploads Background images to insert behind the text, to give it a neaty look!

4.  Awesome Custom CSS section in the option panel to modify the front-end area look of your header and footer.

What MORE can you ask for ;)


= YOU CAN EVEN ADD AN IMAGE! O_o =

Example of adding an image (using HTML tags)

<pre><code><img src=http://www.yourdomainsite.com/mydoggy.png></code></pre>


= How to Enter these Text/ Code / Images? =
 
 1. Simply goto the admin panel

 2. Straight down to "Settings" Menu

 3. Move over and look on the pop out menu for "Header and Footer Commander" settings

 4. Select it and enter your text into the Header and/or Footer boxes that are provided

 5. Check the box to enable footer and header.


= Simple Option Menu = 

The Settings menu for this plugin only has two text area boxes and one checkbox.


= Fully styleable in CSS =

If you would like to change the color of the text, probably add a border and so on, you can use these two divs classes that are incorporated with each function:

 1. For the Header Text area use class headertext =     .headertext

 2. For the Footer Text area use class footertext =     .footertext

= Either Or =
Once you erase your text in one of the text area box, nothing will happen(displayed in front-end) for that specific text box area(function) but allows the other functions to work.
An example is the erasing of the text in the footer area box, while still having my information displayed in the header area box. 
What will happen is that, the information for the header area box will show, granted the check box to enable both options is enabled.

= Would removing the content in the header area affect the footer content area information entered? =

No it would not affect.

 1. Unchecking the "Check to Enable Both Options" Checkbox causes the both the footer and header not to be enabled but keeps your data you entered stored 
    in the text area. Which is very handy for future references. 
 
 2. Once you erase your text in the text area box, nothing will for that specific function but allows the other functions to work.
    An example is the erasing of the text in the footer area box, while still having my information displayed in the header area box.
