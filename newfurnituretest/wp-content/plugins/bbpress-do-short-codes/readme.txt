A simple plugin to enable short codes in bbPress topics and replies.

== Description ==

This add-on plugin for bbPress is extremely simple and does one thing: parses short codes placed in topic and reply content.

By default bbPress does not render short codes placed into forum posts; this enables short codes. That's it.

**Note**: by default, only users with the ability to publish bbPress forums will have their short codes parsed. This can be changed by passing a different capability via the _pw_bbp_parse_shortcodes_cap_ filter.

== Installation ==
